**Decentralized Music Streaming Platform:**

Create a decentralized music streaming platform on the Ethereum blockchain. This project will allow artists to directly share their music with listeners, eliminating intermediaries and providing fair compensation for their work. Here are the key features you can include:

1. **Artist Profiles and Music Uploads:** Artists can create profiles on the platform and upload their original music tracks. Each track will be represented as a unique Non-Fungible Token (NFT) to establish ownership and authenticity.

2. **Streaming and Listening:** Listeners can discover and stream music tracks directly from the platform. Implement a user-friendly interface that showcases album covers, artist information, and track details.

3. **Royalty Payments with Smart Contracts:** Utilize smart contracts to manage royalty payments. When a listener streams a song, a portion of the payment will automatically go to the artist's Ethereum wallet, ensuring fair compensation without the need for intermediaries.

4. **License Management:** Allow artists to choose different types of licenses for their music, such as free, creative commons, or paid licenses. Listeners can see the license type before streaming the music.

5. **User Interaction and Donations:** Implement features for listeners to like, comment, and share their favorite tracks. Additionally, allow users to donate directly to the artists they support.

6. **Decentralized Storage:** Store the music tracks using decentralized storage solutions like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to ensure content availability and censorship resistance.

7. **Playlist Creation and Sharing:** Enable users to create playlists and share them with others on the platform or even external social media.

8. **Social Features:** Implement social features like following artists, receiving notifications about new releases, and connecting with other music enthusiasts.

9. **Secure Wallet Integration:** Integrate Ethereum wallets (e.g., MetaMask) to facilitate secure and transparent transactions for artists' earnings and listeners' donations.

10. **Gas Fee Optimization:** Implement gas fee optimization techniques to minimize transaction costs and enhance user experience.

11. **Testing and Deployment:** Write comprehensive tests for your smart contracts and deploy the application on a test network initially for thorough testing.
